Overview of Cricket Match Analysis

In this analysis, I utilized data from a cricket match to uncover insights and trends. To begin, I connected to a cricket API and retrieved the match data in JSON format. From this data, I extracted key information, including the scorecard and match details, which provided a foundation for further analysis. After extracting the necessary data, I inserted it into an AWS dataset for efficient storage and easy access.
